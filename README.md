# MicroPython Programming –  Learning Materials

This repository contains structured **MicroPython learning materials** designed for beginners and Certificate III/IV ICT students.  
The content is delivered using **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)** and focuses on **hands-on programming concepts** commonly used in **IoT and embedded systems**.

These materials are suitable for classroom delivery, self-paced learning, and assessment preparation.
